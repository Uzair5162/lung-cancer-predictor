# Lung Cancer Predictor App
A flask web app that predicts the userâ€™s risk of lung cancer. Takes 3 metrics as inputs and implements the Random Forest machine learning model with a Kaggle dataset. Dataset was prepared and used with a 70:30 train test split.

*Note that this app is intended to purely be an introduction to machine learning and flask, and thus does NOT constitute medical advice to any degree.*
